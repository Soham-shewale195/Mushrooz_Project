        Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) are one of the most popular edible mushrooms known for their
        oyster-shaped caps and delicate flavor. They are soft, tender, and slightly chewy in texture, making them a
        great addition to various dishes like soups, stir-fries, and pastas. Grown naturally on decaying wood or

        lowering cholesterol, and supporting brain health. Due to their low calorie and glycemic index, they are also
        suitable for diabetic and weight-conscious individuals. Their mild, earthy taste and impressive nutrition make
